V 1.1 :

There is differents ways to open the current movie case :

1 - When "Auto-open cases" option is ON

Case will open when movie info panel will be displayed so by using the "Infopanel" Option you can :

- delay opening up to 5 seconds ("Infopanel" option set to "delayed").
- open case when you want (Infopanel" option set to "Manual" so pressing UP to display infopanel will make the case open).

When "Infopanel" is set to "No" or "On", the only way to open case is to set "Auto-open cases" to OFF (see below).

2 - When "Auto-open cases" option is OFF

Press DOWN key to open, UP key to close on current movie case.

V 1.0 :
- You can open current movie case by pressing DOWN arrow.
